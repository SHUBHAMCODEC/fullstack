# Location/Address Flow Assignment Explanation  

This project is a comprehensive location and address management system that combines functionality, responsiveness, and user-friendly design. Users can search for, save, and manage delivery addresses through a combination of geolocation and manual input, leveraging the Google Maps API for seamless integration.  

    Key Features  

1.   Location Access and Permissions    
   - Users can enable location permissions via their browser to automatically detect their current location.  
   - If permissions are denied or unavailable, users can manually search for their address using a search input integrated with Google Maps.  

2.   Geolocation and Map Integration    
   - Once a location is detected or manually searched, users can see it displayed on a map.  
   - A draggable map pin allows for precise location adjustments.  
   - A "Locate Me" button automatically centers the map to the user's current location.  

3.   Address Form for Delivery Details    
   - Users can add specific details such as house/flat numbers, roads, and areas.  
   - Each address can be categorized as Home, Office, or Friends & Family for easy selection in future transactions.  

4.   Address Management System    
   - A dedicated page allows users to view all saved addresses.  
   - Users can select an address for delivery, update existing details, or delete entries.  
   - A search function enables quick retrieval of previously saved or recently used addresses.  

5.   Bonus Features (Optional Enhancements)    
   -   Favorites  : Save frequently used addresses for quick access.  
   -   Validation  : Validate entered address details to ensure accuracy.  
   -   Map Preview  : Preview the selected address on a map for confirmation before saving.
